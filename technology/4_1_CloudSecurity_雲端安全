### NIST==National Institute of Standards and Technology==美國國家標準暨技術研究院
```
美國國家標準暨技術研究院（National Institute of Standards and Technology，簡寫為NIST）的前身為國家標準局（NBS，1901年~1988年），
是一家測量標準實驗室，屬於美國商務部的非監管機構。該研究所的官方使命為：

Promote U.S. innovation and industrial competitiveness by advancing measurement science, standards, and technology 
in ways that enhance economic security and improve our quality of life.
促進美國的創新和產業競爭力，推進度量衡學、標準、技術以提高經濟安全並改善我們的生活質量。


NIST僱傭有大約2900名科學家、工程師、科技工作者，以及後勤和管理人員，大約1800名輔助工作人員（來自美國公司和國外的工程師和研究員），
另外還有1400名專家分布在國內約350個附屬研究中心裡。

### 五大特色Essential Characteristics:

[1]On-demand self-service. 
```
A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, 
as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider.
```
[2]Broad network access. 
```
Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by 
heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations).
```
[3]Resource pooling. 
```
The provider’s computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, 
with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. 
There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact
location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of
abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage,
processing, memory, and network bandwidth.
```
[4]Rapid elasticity. 
```
Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, 
to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. 
To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can
be appropriated in any quantity at any time.
```
[5]Measured service. 
```
Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability
at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, 
and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing 
transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service.
```

### 類型==服務模型Service Models:

[1]Software as a Service (SaaS)==> Gmail, office 365,  youtube, facebook,
```
The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider’s applications running on a cloud infrastructure. 
The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, 
such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the
underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or
even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited userspecific
application configuration settings.
```
[1]Platform as a Service (PaaS)==> Google Cloud platform, Microsoft Azure Platform, Amazon Web Services Cloud
```
The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer-created or acquired applications 
created using programming.
Typically this is done on a pay-per-use or charge-per-use basis. 
A cloud infrastructure is the collection of hardware and software that enables the five essential characteristics of cloud
computing. 
The cloud infrastructure can be viewed as containing both a physical layer and an abstraction layer. 
The physical layer consists of the hardware resources that are necessary to support the cloud services being provided, 
and typically includes server, storage and network components. 
The abstraction layer consists of the software deployed across the physical layer,
which manifests the essential cloud characteristics. Conceptually the abstraction layer sits above the physical layer.
languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider.

The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers,
operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly
configuration settings for the application-hosting environment.
```
[2]Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). 
The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources 
where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. 
The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, 
storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls).
```
### 部屬模型Deployment Models:

[1]Private cloud私有雲
```
The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). 
It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist
on or off premises.
```

[2]Community cloud.社群雲 
```
The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations 
that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). 
It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third
party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.
```

[3]Public cloud.公有雲
```
The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. 
It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or
some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.
```
[4]Hybrid cloud.混合雲 
```
The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud
infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound
together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application
portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds).

雲端技術乃新世代資訊科技的基礎。作為新世代的資訊科技人，若不能掌握雲端技術則勢必被接下來的時代淘汰。
雲端技術擁有其有別於傳統資訊科技的特性，如軟體思維、快速彈性、低整體擁有成本及資源共享等特性。

然而，雲端技術的便利性，同時加深人們對於雲端技術的依賴，當新一代資訊科技變得如同傳統水電一般的呼之即來、揮之即去時，
這也意味著當系統中斷、服務停止時，人們將承受莫大損害，而這也暗示著雲端安全的重要性。

CCSP®認證是二大安全組織 – (ISC)2及CSA (雲端安全聯盟)兩大國際原廠聯手打造的頂級雲端資安認證。
